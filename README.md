Visualize a dataset named Meteorites Landings in a 3-D canvas using p5.js (JavaScript library for creative coding).  
Variables used: reclat, reclong, recclass, mass (g) - recorded the latitude, longtitude, class and mass of the meteorites landed.  
Filter: only includes meteorites for which these four variables are not blank and whose mass is ranging from 30,000 to 60,000,000 g.  
Each box represents a meteorite landing - the box's height represents the meteorite's mass and its color represents the class it belongs to. There are 3 classes: stone, stony iron, and iron meteorites.
