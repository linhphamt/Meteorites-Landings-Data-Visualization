# Meteorite Landings Visualization
A 3-D animation using JavaScript (p5.js library for creative coding) to visualize 634 meteorite landings

Overview
---------------------------
* Variables used: reclat, reclong, recclass, mass (g) - recorded the latitude, longitude, class, and mass of the meteorites landed.  
* Filter: only includes meteorites for which these four variables are not blank and whose mass ranges from 30,000 to 60,000,000 g.  
* Each box represents a meteorite landing - the box's height represents the meteorite's mass, and its color represents the class it belongs to. * There are 3 classes: stone, stony iron, and iron meteorites.
